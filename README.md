# Gibbs Sampling for Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model

Refer to <http://dataera.org/2014/10/gibbs-sampling-for-mixed-membership-stochastic-blockmodels/> for detailed derivation of sampling distributions.

It is extremely sensititve to initial parameter values. Change srand(1) to srand(time(NULL)) for randomized version.
